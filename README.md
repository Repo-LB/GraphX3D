# GraphX3D
Software 3D Engine - (Dynamic Link Library For Visual Basic .NET)


This project's goal is to recreate a 3D Graphics Engine in order to learn how 3D Graphics work, and how to use 3D Engines in the most optimal way. The entire software runs on the CPU(we don't want the graphic card to take any of the work away since the goal is learning).  

IMPORTANT NOTICE -> This is still a work in progress, I usually prefer releasing finished and fully tested programs. Updates will follow soon.  

Upcomming Critical Updates: 

1)Depth Buffer(Fix Occlusion)  
2)Interpolation for Shader(Per-pixel Ligthing Instead of Per-Triangle)  

Upcomming Secondary Updates:

1)Rework on Rasterizer + Performance  
2)Rework the code structure and naming, child-proof all public functions  
3)Improve Mesh Object importation routine(wider range of filetypes)  
4)Texturing
